# lidar_slam_test

This is a test node to ensure the good behavior of the SLAM along development. It relies on reference data which must be created with a SLAM reference version.
No reference data nor dataset is supplied with this package for now. It is mainly used for the Kitware SLAM CI.

## Basic usage

**1. Create the reference data**

```bash
ros2 launch lidar_slam_test slam.py test_data:="path/to/rosbag" res_path:="path/to/folder/where/to/store/log/files"
```

This creates 2 CSV files : _path/to/folder/where/to/store/log/files/Poses.csv_ and _path/to/folder/where/to/store/log/files/Evaluators.csv_. The first file contains the poses for each frame received in an inline matrix format (x,y,z,x0,y0,z0,x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2 xi being the first element of the ith column of the rotation matrix). The second one contains some confidence estimators relative to each pose: the overlap, the number of matches and the computation time. Both file contain the corresponding timestamp.

**2. Run a comparison**

```bash
ros2 launch lidar_slam_test slam.py test_data:="path/to/rosbag" ref_path:="path/to/reference/folder" res_path:="path/to/folder/where/to/store/log/files"
```

Where _"path/to/reference/folder"_ refers to the previous log storage folder or to the new folder where the reference log data have been store.
This compares each pose and relative confidence estimator values and computes some difference with reference log data. It qualifies the success or failure of the test relatively to some thresholds (see next section) and print some valuable metrics.

## Options

Available parameters to launch file :

The config file [`params/eval.yaml`](params/eval.yaml) contains some threshold parameters to qualify the results :

* **_nb_frames_dropped_** : Maximum number of frames dropped during replay. This can happen because of communication issues.
* **_time_threshold_** : Maximum computation time difference using average time on all frames.
* **_angle_threshold_** : Maximum rotation difference between relative transforms of reference and of current version.
* **_position_threshold_** : Maximum translation difference between relative transforms of reference and of current version.

**NOTE :** One can optionally activate the verbose option : ```verbose:=true``` in the ros2 launch command to print the difference with reference for each pose in order to debug. This overloads the verbose parameter of the yaml file.

## CI

The basic CI usage is the following :

* **1st job**
   1. Checkout master reference branch
   2. Create the reference data
   3. Store them

* **2nd job (dependent)**
   4. Checkout the test branch
   5. Load reference data
   5. Run the comparison
