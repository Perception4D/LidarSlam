      #     Tworld is equal to previous Tworld. Fast, but may lead to unstable and imprecise
      #     Localization step if motion is important.
      #  1) Previous motion is linearly extrapolated to estimate new Tworld pose from the
      #     2 previous poses. Fast and precise if motion is roughly constant and continuous
      #  2) Estimate Trelative (and therefore Tworld) by globally registering new frame
      #     on previous frame. Slower and need textured enough environment, but do not
      #     rely on constant motion hypothesis.
      #  3) Previous motion is linearly extrapolated to estimate new Tworld pose from
      #     the 2 previous poses. Then this estimation is refined by globally registering
      #     new frame on previous frame. Slower and need textured enough environment,
      #     but should be more precise and rely less on constant motion hypothesis.

      #     - End scan pose is optimized using rigid registration of raw scan and map.

      #     - Begin and end scan poses are linearly interpolated using ego-motion.
      #     - Scan is linearly undistorted between begin and end scan poses.
