/aggregation:
  ros__parameters:
    leaf_size: 0.1 # Voxel size (eq approx space between points after downsampling)
    max_size: 500. # Maximum size of the scene (from the last lidar slam position)
                   # Warning : should be at least as large as one frame
    min_points_per_voxel: 2 # Minimum number of points in a voxel to extract it as non moving object
    min_dist_around_trajectory: 1. # Minimum distance of the points from the sensor to aggregate them
    max_dist_around_trajectory: -1. # Maximum distance of the points from the sensor to aggregate them

    # Slice extraction parameters
    slice:
      enable: false        # Enable or disable the slice extraction and the area computation
      traj_length: 1.      # [meters] Length of trajectory to consider to define the slice plane
      width: 0.2           # [meters] Width of the pointcloud slice to take to create the slice projection
      max_dist: 4.         # [meters] Maximal distance of the points from the trajectory position onto the slice plane
      angle_resolution: 3. # [°] Resolution of the slice pointcloud w.r.t the trajectory position

    # Parameters to extract a slice of points in the z axis
    # To extract the ground, it should be on z axis of base_link,
    # if not, base_link should be adapted in slam params or in TF tree
    z_slice:
      enable: false         # Enable or disable the horizontal slice extraction
      height_position: -0.5 # [meters] Distance on z axis of the LiDAR frame
      width: 0.2            # [meters] Width of the slice we want to extract. It will be centered at height.
      invert: false         # Extract or reject the slice

    obstacle:
      enable: false     # Enable or disable the obstacle extraction
      ref_map_path: ""  # Reference map to find new objects
      decay_time: 1000. # [seconds] Maximum lifetime of an obstacle and/or a new point
      merge_dist: 0.5   # [meters] Maximum distance to merge two clusters
      publish_occupancy_grid: false # Whether or not to publish the occupancy grid as debug info.
                                    # This can add significant computation time
      min_marker_size: 0.3 # [meters] Minimal diagonal size of a marker to consider it is an obstacle
