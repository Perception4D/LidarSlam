/aggregation:
  ros__parameters:
    leaf_size: 0.1 # Voxel size (eq approx space between points after downsampling)
    max_size: 500. # Maximum size of the scene (from the last lidar slam position)
                   # Warning : should be at least as large as one frame
    min_points_per_voxel: 2 # Minimum number of points in a voxel to extract it as non moving object
    min_dist_around_trajectory: 1. # Minimum distance of the points from the sensor to aggregate them
    max_dist_around_trajectory: -1. # Maximum distance of the points from the sensor to aggregate them

    # Slice extraction parameters
    slice:
      enable: false        # Enable or disable the slice extraction and the area computation
      traj_length: 1.      # [meters] Length of trajectory to consider to define the slice plane
      width: 0.2           # [meters] Width of the pointcloud slice to take to create the slice projection
      max_dist: 4.         # [meters] Maximal distance of the points from the trajectory position onto the slice plane
      angle_resolution: 3. # [Â°] Resolution of the slice pointcloud w.r.t the trajectory position
